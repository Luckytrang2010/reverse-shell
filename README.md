# how to use ngrok

if you don't have ngrok, [download it here](https://ngrok.com/download)

1. type in ``ngrok tcp 22`` *port 22 (ssh) is pretty much for this*

2. now enter the source ip and port in main.py running, it can look like ``0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345``

other steps are self explanatory, you just have to wait for the victim to execute the payload it created for you
